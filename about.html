                <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site! </h1>
                <p>
                    Allow me to share a little bit about myself: my name is John Robison, a senior at
                    Columbia University studying mathematics and statistics. I started programming as a junior in college because I found
                    the discipline interesting and extremely challenging (but also quite rewarding). I have dedicated a great deal of the past
                    year to understanding Computer Science on a deeper level because I believe computers, when paired with mathematics,
                    can be used to solve some of the world's most pressing issues. I am interested in using computer science as a tool to help
                    our society reimagine what can be achieved by the collective. My primary interests are in mathematics, behavioral economics,
                    blockchain technology, and machine learning applications. I hope to build a business one day that utilizes my skills and interests  as 
                    a vector for broader social change. Thanks for visiting!
                </p>
                <p>Best regards,</p>
                <p>
